     <p> To My Love Princess Kyla E Cabaya,  <p></p>

       <p> In the gentle glow of the morning light,  
        Your presence feels so warm, so bright.  
        Each new day begins with you,  
        My heart beats steady, strong, and true. <p>  
        
        <p> The stars above, in their quiet way,  
        Try to capture your beauty every day.  
        But their sparkle could never shine as deep,  
        As the love you give, the joy I keep. <p>  
        
        <p> You’re the pen to my life’s blank page,  
        Writing a story that grows with age.  
        Every smile, a line of grace,  
        Every touch, a safe embrace.  <p>
        
        <p>Even if the world turned upside down,  
        If time stopped spinning all around,  
        My heart would still hum your tune,  
        And sing for you beneath the moon.  <p>
        
        <p> </p>So here I am, with words to say,  
        You are my light, my every day.  
        In your love, I’ve found my start—  
        The treasure etched into my heart.  </p>
</body>
